- 👋 Hi, I’m Abhishek Tiwari
- ⭐️ I’m currently learning to code in __kotlin.__ Although I have __no__ previous __coding experience,__ I believe these techniques have tremendous potential to improve the lives of the common man.
- 🌱 I want to work in the field of making life easier for farmers and students from economically weaker sections of society.
- 📫 Just send me a message on Instagram to contact me. @prabhishek.in
